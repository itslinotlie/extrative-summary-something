# First Python ML Project + Docker

### My Struggles with Docker

"Use Docker, it's the future for delivering applications. It containerizes your application so that anyone, regardleses of their OS or previously installed packages, will be able to run your program." â€”the voice in my head

I've gone through maybe 10 hours of Docker tutorial content (at 2x speed) and none of them answered all my questions (and yes, I can understand things at 2x speed because I normally watch at 2.5-3x speed :/). Here is me answering the questions I had so that your brain doesn't overflow with stackoverflow articles:

### Why do almost all of dockerfiles start with a Linux base layer?

"This is a python project, why in the world would I want Linux?" was the question in my head whenever I watched a tutorial on Docker. Wouldn't a Python project require a Python layer?? Through tutorial-hell, I realized, hey, how do I actually run my files in a Docker container? It was at that point did I realize the need for an operating system: for terminal access. With the proper things installed, you can run "python < file name >" in the terminal to run a python script. I'm sure there are cases for python layers, but I'm not sure when that would be needed.
